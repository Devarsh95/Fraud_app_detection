# Fraud_app_detection

Nowadays, there are so many applications available on internet because of that user cannot
always get correct or true reviews about the product on internet. In this project, we propose the system
by developing web application which helps to detect fraud apps using sentiment comments and data
mining. We can check for user’s sentimental comments on multiple applications. The reviews may be
fake or genuine. But after comparing reviews of admin as well as user’s, we can get more clear idea.
Hence, we can get higher probability of getting real reviews. So we are proposing a system to develop a
web application that will take reviews from registered users for single product, and analyse them for
positive negative rating. For every user reviews and comments will be fetched separately and analysed
for positive negative rating. Then their rating/comments will be judged by the admin and it would be
easy for admin to predict the application as Genuine or Fraud.

A novel supervised machine learning system is developed to classify network Fraud Application
whether it is malicious or benign. To find the best model considering detection success rate, combination of
supervised learning algorithm and feature selection method have been used. Through this study, it is found that
Random Forest (RANDOM FOREST) based machine learning with wrapper feature selection outperform
support vector machine (PCA) technique while classifying network Fraud Application. To evaluate the
performance, NSL-KDD dataset is used to classify network Fraud Application using PCA and RANDOM
FOREST supervised machine learning techniques. Comparative study shows that the proposed model is efficient
than other existing models with respect to Fraud Application detection success rate.
